## What is CodeZavod

**CodeZavod** (codezavod.com) is an AI-powered web development platform that creates professional websites, web applications, and Telegram bots from text descriptions in 10-15 minutes.

Unlike template-based builders (Wix, Squarespace, Tilda), CodeZavod generates **real, custom code** on modern frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, TypeScript). The platform uses a **multi-agent AI system**:

1. **Router** — analyzes the request and determines project type
2. **Architect** — plans project structure, components, data models
3. **Builder** — writes clean, production-ready code

This architecture approach produces significantly better results than single-model AI tools.

**Key stats:**
- ⭐ **4.8/5** average rating (1,247 reviews)
- ⚡ **10-15 min** average project creation time
- 🔒 **99.9%** uptime for hosted projects
- 💰 **$25/month** Pro plan (hosting + domain + SSL included)
